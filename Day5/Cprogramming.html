    <p><h5>C</h5> (pronounced like the letter c) [6] is a general purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.
        A successor to the programming language B,C was originally developed Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to utilities running on unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernal for the Unix operating system. [8] During the 1980s,C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for almost (citation needed) all mmodern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardised by ANSI since 1989 since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the ISO.</p>
